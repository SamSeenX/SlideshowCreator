## Description

Slideshow Creator is a Python script that creates smooth zoom transitions between images with face detection. It detects faces in each image, creates transitions by zooming out from the first image and zooming in to the second image, applies special effects during transitions, and combines all frames into a high-quality video with optional background music.

## Main Features

- Detects faces in each image.
- Creates transitions by zooming out from the first image and zooming in to the second image.
- Applies special effects during transitions (fisheye/stretching and radial blur).
- Combines all frames into a high-quality video with optional background music.

## Installation and Running

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- tqdm (`tqdm`)

### Installation Steps

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python-headless numpy mediapipe tqdm
   ```

### Running the Script

1. Place images in the `input` directory.
2. Place background music in the `music` directory (optional).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python slideshow_creator.py
   ```
